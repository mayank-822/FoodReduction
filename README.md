# Food Waste Reduction Platform

## Project Description

The Food Waste Reduction Platform is a blockchain-based solution that connects surplus food producers with consumers and food banks to minimize food waste. Built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts, this platform creates a decentralized marketplace where restaurants, grocery stores, farms, and other food producers can list their surplus food items before they expire, while consumers and food banks can claim these items at discounted rates.

The platform incentivizes participation through a reward token system, where users earn tokens for listing surplus food and successfully rescuing food from waste. Food banks receive special 50% discounts to ensure food reaches those most in need.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a world where food waste is minimized through technology-enabled connections between surplus food producers and those who can utilize the food effectively. We aim to:

- **Reduce Environmental Impact**: Minimize food waste that contributes to greenhouse gas emissions in landfills
- **Address Food Insecurity**: Connect surplus food with food banks and communities in need
- **Create Economic Value**: Allow producers to recover some value from surplus food instead of disposal costs
- **Build Community**: Foster connections between local food producers and consumers
- **Incentivize Sustainability**: Reward participants for environmental stewardship through tokenomics

The platform leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency, trust, and immutable records of food rescue activities, creating accountability and building reputation systems for all participants.

## Future Scope

### Phase 1 - Current Implementation
- ✅ Basic surplus food listing functionality
- ✅ Food claiming system with consumer/food bank differentiation
- ✅ Reward token system for incentivizing participation
- ✅ User profile and reputation tracking

### Phase 2 - Enhanced Features
